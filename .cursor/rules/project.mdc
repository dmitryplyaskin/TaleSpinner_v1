# Project overview: TaleSpinner

**TaleSpinner** is a **self-hosted web application** (currently web-only) for interacting with **LLMs** in a chat/RP workflow, with support for reusable **agent cards**, **personas**, **instructions/system prompts**, **templates**, and **pipelines**.

## What we build in this repo

- **Chat orchestration**: streaming generation, abort/retry, message history handling, and multi-branch / swipe-like UX where applicable.
- **Reusable assets**:
  - **Agent cards / chats** (including imported metadata when relevant)
  - **User personas**
  - **Instructions** (system prompt presets)
  - **Templates** (prompt templating)
  - **Pipelines** (multi-step prompt chains; agents/workflows will grow here)
  - **Samplers / generation settings**
- **App configuration**: self-hosted settings, UI preferences, provider configuration.
- **Provider integrations**: **OpenRouter is primary**; additional providers may be added later.

## Platform & deployment

- **Target platform**: web-only for now.
- **Deployment**: self-hosted.

## Persistence roadmap

- **Current state**: some data/settings are stored in JSON (legacy / transitional).
- **Near-term goal**: migrate persistence to a proper **database** (JSON storage will be removed).

## Language & localization

- **Current focus**: English-only UI and user-facing strings.
- **Later**: i18n will be introduced (not a hard requirement for every new UI string today).

## Repository layout (high-level)

- `web/` — frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript)
- `server/` — backend API (Node.js + TypeScript)
- `shared/types/` — shared TypeScript contracts between frontend and backend
