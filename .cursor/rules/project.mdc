# Project overview: SillyInnkeeper

**SillyInnkeeper** is a desktop/web application for convenient work with **SillyTavern character cards** (PNG files with embedded metadata).
The core goal is to handle **large libraries (hundreds/thousands of cards)** with fast scanning, indexing, search, filtering, sorting, and a good viewing/editing experience.

## What we build in this repo

- **Card library management**: scan folders, index PNG cards, track changes automatically, detect/manage duplicates.
- **Fast exploration UX**: grid with thumbnails, powerful filters (name/creator/tags/date/content/tokens/spec version), and detailed card view (tabs, raw JSON).
- **SillyTavern integration**: “Play” action and automatic import via the companion extension `ST-Extension-SillyInnkeeper`.
- **Export/import compatibility**: export PNG with correct metadata; support Character Card **V1/V2/V3**.
- **Performance first**: the app must remain responsive with thousands of files.
- **Localization**: RU/EN support is mandatory across UI and user-facing messages.

## Non-goals / notes

SillyInnkeeper is a community tool and is **not officially affiliated** with SillyTavern.
