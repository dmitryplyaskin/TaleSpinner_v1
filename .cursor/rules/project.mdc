# System context: TaleSpinner

TaleSpinner is a **self-hosted web application** for interacting with LLMs in a chat / roleplay workflow.

## Scope of this repository

- Chat orchestration:
  - streaming generation
  - abort / retry
  - message history handling
  - multi-branch / “swipe-like” UX where applicable
- Reusable assets:
  - agent cards / chats (including imported metadata when relevant)
  - user personas
  - instructions (system prompt presets)
  - templates (prompt templating)
  - pipelines (multi-step prompt chains; agents / workflows live here)
  - samplers / generation settings
- App configuration:
  - self-hosted settings
  - UI preferences
  - provider configuration
- Provider integrations:
  - primary: **OpenRouter**
  - others may be added later

## Platform & deployment

- Target platform: web-only (for now)
- Deployment: self-hosted

## Persistence

- Current: some data / settings stored as JSON (legacy / transitional)
- Goal: migrate persistence to a proper database (JSON storage will be removed)

## Language & localization

- Current: English-only UI and user-facing strings
- Future: i18n can be introduced later (not required for each new string today)

## Repository layout (high level)

- `web/` — frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript)
- `server/` — backend API (Node.js + TypeScript)
- `shared/types/` — shared TypeScript contracts between frontend and backend
